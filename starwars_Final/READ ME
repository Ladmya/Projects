API // ASYNC // FETCH 

NB: to use with GOOGLE CHROME only

We were asked to create an API with an asynchronous function.
We created one that randomly selects a character from a Star Wars JSON file and provides information about it with a matching image. Like a Pokemon card.

Tech stack : JS / CSS / HTML

FUNCTIONALITIES

 1 => Fetch API 
 2 => Turn response into 1st JSON 
 3 => Select randomly one character 
 4 => Create a HTML element with information about the character 
 5 => Assign CSS specific to the character
 6 => Fetch & Turn response into 2nd JSON
 7 => Loader
 8 => Music
 9 => Refresh button


DIFFICULTIES

Creating class in JS to be used in the CSS for each character
Converting one value (url) from the first Json with the second (simple yet super difficult to figure out)
Figuring out the execution order when fetching
Getting to understand how to build CSS

TO ADD

Error messages
Converting the CSS (all elements positions) and the HTML (autoplay) for Firefox
