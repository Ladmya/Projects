### FURNITURE ECOM

**1 - DESCRIPTION**

Build an e-commerce website to sell furnitures, in 2 weeks (MVP delivery).We had 9 people divided in 2 groups Front and Back, switching front to back (& vice versa) after 1 week.
We voted for the tech stack, segmented & attributed tasks according to the people available to work.
We also used Notion to keep track of the tasks planning & execution, created 2 repositories and several branches.

**REQUIREMENTS**

	•	Creation of a Database & API 
	•	Using at least 1 framework
	•	Fetching product details & images from db
	•	Website : 
	⁃	homepage
	⁃	product page
	⁃	product insert (clickable)
	⁃	category page
	⁃	sign in
	⁃	login / logout
	⁃	cart (uncompleted)


**TECH STACK**

FRONT : VUEJS // JS - HTML - CSS // FIGMA
BACK : NODEJS // EXPRESSJS // JS - SQL // PHPMYADMIN // POSTMAN // MAMP

PACKAGES : CORS / MYSQL / EXPRESS // NODEJS
IDE : VS CODE

**CODING TOPICS** 

API // ASYNC // ROUTES FRONT <=> BACK // DB CREATION // SQL REQUEST // FRAMEWORK USE // CART //  SESSION

**2 - INSTALLATION - LAUNCH THE WEBSITE**

*!! Mind the port number for both front & back, they should match the ones provided by the servers !!*  
  -  In VS Code : install VueJs for the front (open from vue-project) & NodeJS + ExpressJS + mySQL     
     for the back.
  -  Launch Mamp
  -  PhpMyAdmin for database (check port number)
  -  Commands in Vs Code console :     
     In back folder  => node server.js 
     In front folder =>  cd vue-project => npm run dev

**3 - FUNCTIONALITIES**

1 => Brainstorm stack & architecture         
     Group creation, front & back

         **Group 2:**
2 => Back & front architecture conception
3 => DB creation (relational)
4 => Server set up (using Express)

6 => Controllers creation (Promises & SQL requests)
         **Group switch to 1:**

         **Group 1:**

**4 - DIFFICULTIES & DISCOVERIES**

**TEAM WORK ORGANISATION** : 
- Daily timed stand up meetings (including video attendance) => going to the essential (review what’s done / what to do / adjust collaborations)
- Communication tools mastery (covid cluster) =>  for peer programming & code review / working with half the team on 2 weeks
- Initiating, sustaining & driving motivation through the project
- Constantly revising tasks according to code level & understanding of the features to develop while monitoring progress

**TECH WISE** :   
  - Architecture & system design
  - Discovery of first frameworks / package
  - Deeper knowledge of an API within 2 frameworks
  - How front & back communicate through an API
